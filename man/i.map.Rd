\arguments{
\item{id}{A list obtained with function 'wos'.}

\item{homeCountry}{A character string specifying the country of origin of the researcher. Look at map$country for the complete list. If NULL, the country with most hits in Web of Science is used.}

\item{sea.col}{A character indicating the color of the sea.}

\item{country.col}{A character indicating the color of the countries in the world.}

\item{country.border.col}{A character indicating the color of the border among countries.}

\item{country.border.tick}{An integer value defining the size of the border line among countries.}

\item{line.curvature}{An integer value defining the curvature of the line connecting the home country with the countries of collaborators.}

\item{line.size}{An integer value defining the size of the line connecting the home country with the countries of collaborators.}

\item{line.alpha}{An integer value defining the transparency of the line connecting the home country with the countries of collaborators.}

\item{line.color}{A character indicating the color of the line connecting the home country with the countries of collaborators.}

\item{country.point.color}{A character indicating the color of the vertex representing each country.}

\item{country.point.line}{A character indicating the color of line of the vertex representing each country.}

\item{country.point.alpha}{An integer value defining the transparency of the vertex representing each country.}

\item{country.size.proportional}{Logical. If TRUE, the size of each country is proportional to the number of collaborations.}

\item{country.point.size}{An integer value defining the size of vertex representing each country. Ignored if country.size.proportional = TRUE.}

\item{homeCountry.point.color}{A character indicating the color of the vertex representing the home country.}

\item{homeCountry.point.line}{A character indicating the color of the line of the vertex representing the home country.}

\item{homeCountry.point.alpha}{An integer value defining the transparency of the vertex representing the home country.}

\item{homeCountry.point.size}{An integer value defining the size of vertex representing the home country.}
